### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Vitor and I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Electronics Engineering and a big passion for creating solutions that make a difference. Whether itâ€™s designing smart electronics or coding apps to solve real-world problems, I love turning ideas into reality.

Iâ€™ve had the chance to work on some pretty exciting projectsâ€”building tools, streamlining workflows, and exploring new technologies to make life easier for businesses and users alike. Along the way, Iâ€™ve learned the value of adaptability and teamwork, always pushing myself to take on challenges and grow as an engineer.

From iOS and Android to web development, Iâ€™ve built up a versatile tech stack that helps me tackle projects from all angles. But what I enjoy most is collaborating with others, whether itâ€™s brainstorming ideas, debugging tricky code, or celebrating a successful launch.

At the end of the day, Iâ€™m all about learning, building, and creating things that leave a positive impact. If youâ€™re into innovative projects or just want to chat about tech, feel free to connectâ€”Iâ€™m always up for cool collaborations or sharing ideas. ðŸš€
