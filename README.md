### Hi there! üëãüèª

I am a Software Engineer with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Electronics Engineering, passionate about creating scalable, sustainable and user friendly solutions. I believe engineering, when applied strategically, drives significant change for businesses and communities.

I remain committed to a continuous improvement and innovation mindset.

At Conta Azul, I contributed to developing mobile apps for iOS and Android using Flutter, and integrated APIs in a Go/TypeScript BFF. My work enhanced features, boosted performance, and leveraged AWS Lambda, Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and DataDog. We employed Clean Architecture, TDD, SOLID principles, and CI/CD practices while documenting our mobile and banking architecture in line with agile Scrum.

As CTO at Navalcare, I led the creation of a mobile ecosystem using Flutter, Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication, Cloud Messaging, Node.js, GCP, and Google App Scripts. This platform featured offline-first capabilities and automations that reduced manual tasks by over 70%. I developed software and hardware prototypes‚Äîincluding ESP32 firmware‚Äîensuring quality and reliability of the final products, supported by comprehensive documentation.

My studies at UFSC and research at the Radio Frequency Laboratory (LRF) taught me to break down complex challenges into manageable tasks, enabling me to achieve clear goals and choose the best tradeoffs for delivering valuable results based on each project‚Äôs specifications.
